# Putting Together a Development Environment
Every job requires tools to get the job done. A web developer needs the following tools to accomplish their work:

## Text editor
Used to edit files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. A good text editor will be context sensitive, meaning it will be aware of the language which you are composing and highlight the syntax of that language to make editing easier.

## Browser
For previewing and testing web code. Google Chrome has a nice set of integrated developers tools that make CSS and JavaScript debugging easier.

## Debugger
A web debugger will be able to display html and css and allow you to make dynamic edits to the code and view the results. The script debugger provides tools such as breakpoints, single stepping, dynamic watch points and DOM view, which are very useful when writing JavaScript code.

## IDE
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is an entire toolbox full of tools that work together. Edits that are made in the text editor appear in the browser with a built in debugger for catching programming mistakes.

### Brackets
